      "This type of file provides a human-readable format for storing and manipulating data when developers build software. It was initially designed based on Javascript object notation but has since grown in popularity, so many different languages are compatible with JSON data."
  },
  {
    "Paragraph":
      "The JSON data format is an open standard file (.json) and data format used for data interchange through various forms of technology. The most common use of JSON data and files is to read data from a server for a website or web application to display — and change data given the correct permissions."

  {
    "Paragraph":
      "But, that is not the only thing it is used for. Computer applications, programs, mobile apps, and much more all use JSON files. It is so universal that one might argue it is used virtually everywhere."

    "Paragraph":
    "Making and following a task schedule reduces anxiety. As you check off items on your “to-do” list, you can see that you are making tangible progress. This helps you avoid feeling stressed out with worry about whether you are getting things done.Good time management gives you extra time to spend in your daily life. People who can time-manage effectively enjoy having more time to spend on hobbies or other personal pursuits."
  },{

    "Paragraph":"Managing time well leads to more opportunities and less time wasted on trivial activities. Good time management skills are key qualities that employers look for. The ability to prioritize and schedule work is extremely desirable for any organization.Individuals who practice good time management are able to better achieve goals and objectives, and do so in a shorter length of time."
  },{
    "Paragraph":"Setting time constraints for completing tasks helps you be more focused and efficient. Making the small extra effort to decide on how much time you need to allot for each task can also help you recognize potential problems before they arise. That way you can make plans for dealing with them."
  },{
    "Paragraph":"For example, assume you need to write up five reviews in time for a meeting. However, you realize that youll only be able to get four of them done in the time remaining before the meeting. If you become aware of this fact well in advance, you may be able to easily delegate writing up one of the reviews to someone else. However, if you hadn’t bothered to do a time check on your tasks beforehand, you might have ended up not realizing your time problem until just an hour before the meeting. At that point, it might be considerably more difficult to find someone to delegate one of the reviews to, and more difficult for them to fit the task into their day, too."
  },{
    "Paragraph":"Utilize your calendar for more long-term time management. Write down the deadlines for projects, or for tasks that are part of completing the overall project. Think about which days might be best to dedicate to specific tasks. For example, you might need to plan a meeting to discuss cash flow on a day when you know the company CFO is available."
  },{
    "Paragraph":"The inability to plan ahead and stick to goals means poor efficiency. For example, if there are several important tasks to complete, an effective plan would be to complete related tasks together or sequentially. However, if you don’t plan ahead, you could end up having to jump back and forth, or backtrack, in doing your work. That translates to reduced efficiency and lower productivity."
  },{
    "Paragraph":"If clients or your employer cannot rely on you to complete tasks in a timely manner, their expectations and perceptions of you are adversely affected. If a client cannot rely on you to get something done on time, they will likely take their business elsewherePoor time management typically makes the quality of your work suffer. For example, having to rush to complete tasks at the last minute usually compromises quality.By not knowing what the next task is, you suffer from loss of control of your life. That can contribute to higher stress levels and anxiety."
